    <p>A visual programming interface, to make programming a function node easier. Just drag and drop <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a> 
    blocks to build your program logic, without having to write the Javascript code yourself.  The generated javascript code will be run against the messages being received by the node.</p>
    <p>The messages are passed in as a JavaScript object called <code>msg</code>.</p>
    <p>By convention it will have a <code>msg.payload</code> property containing the body of the message.</p>
    <p>The function is expected to return a message object (or multiple message objects), but can choose to return nothing in order to halt a flow.</p>
    <p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-blockly">Github</a> for a basic introduction on writing functions with Blockly, or our 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-blockly/wiki">wiki</a> pages for tutorials.  And lot's of other Blockly documentation (tutorials, video's, ...) can be found all over the internet.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The Blockly editor contains the basic blocks provided by Google.  In addition a number of extra blocks have been provided.  A number of those extra blocks allow to communicate with the Node-Red API, similar to a normal function node.</p>
    <h3>CAUTION</h3>
    <p>Blockly is 1-based while Javascript is 0-based, which means that Blockly starts counting from 0 in a loop.  The numbers are <strong>automatically decremented</strong> (-1) in the generated code.</p>
